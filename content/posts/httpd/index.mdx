To install the Apache HTTP server (httpd) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, you can use the dnf package manager. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open Terminal: Log in to your RHEL 9 system and open a terminal window.
2. Update System: It's a good practice to update your system's package repository before installing new software. You can do this by running:

```
sudo dnf update
```

3. Install httpd Package: Use dnf to install the httpd package:
```
sudo dnf install httpd
```

4.Start httpd Service: After installation, start the httpd service:
```
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

5. Enable httpd Service to Start on Boot: To ensure that httpd starts automatically every time your system boots up, enable the service:
```
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

6. Verify Installation: To confirm that Apache HTTP server is running, you can check its status:
```
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

7. Accessing the Default Web Page: Open a web browser and type in your server's IP address or hostname. You should see the default Apache welcome page if everything is set up correctly.

### Selinux
If SELinux is enabled on your RHEL 9 system, you might encounter some issues with Apache HTTP Server (httpd) if it's not properly configured to work with SELinux. Here are some steps to ensure that SELinux is properly configured for httpd:

Check SELinux Status: First, check the status of SELinux on your system to ensure it's enabled:
```
sudo sestatus
```

This command will display the current status of SELinux.

Install SELinux Utilities: If SELinux is enabled, but you don't have the necessary utilities installed to manage it, you can install them using dnf:
```
sudo dnf install policycoreutils-python-utils
```

Configure SELinux Policies: You may need to configure SELinux policies to allow Apache HTTP Server to function correctly. You can do this using SELinux boolean values. For example, to allow httpd to connect to the network, you can set the httpd_can_network_connect boolean:

```
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
```

You may need to set other SELinux booleans depending on your specific requirements and configurations. Refer to the SELinux documentation or troubleshoot based on any SELinux-related errors you encounter.
Check SELinux Audit Logs: If you encounter issues with SELinux preventing httpd from functioning correctly, you can check the SELinux audit logs for any denials:
```
sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent
```

This command will display recent SELinux denials related to httpd. You can use this information to troubleshoot and adjust SELinux policies as needed.
Restart httpd: After making any changes to SELinux policies, it's a good idea to restart the httpd service:
```
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

### Firewall
If the firewall is enabled on your RHEL 9 system, you'll need to configure it to allow traffic on the ports used by Apache HTTP Server (httpd) to ensure that your web server is accessible. By default, httpd uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. Here's how you can configure the firewall to allow traffic on these ports:

Check Firewall Status: First, check the status of the firewall to see if it's enabled:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --state
```
This command will show whether the firewall is running or not.
Allow HTTP and HTTPS Traffic: If the firewall is enabled, you'll need to allow traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to allow web traffic to reach your server. You can do this using the firewall-cmd command:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent
```

These commands will add permanent rules to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic through the firewall.
Reload Firewall Configuration: After adding the rules, reload the firewall configuration to apply the changes:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Verify Configuration: You can verify that the rules have been added correctly by listing the services allowed in the public zone:
```
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services
```
This command should display http and https among the allowed services.
Check Connectivity: Finally, check if your web server is accessible from outside your local network. You can use a web browser or tools like curl or wget to access your server:
```
curl http://your_server_ip
```

Replace **your_server_ip** with the actual IP address of your server. You should see the default Apache welcome page if everything is configured correctly.
